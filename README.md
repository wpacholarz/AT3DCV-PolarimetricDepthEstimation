# PolarimetricDepthEstimation

Welcome to the repository of our project on Polarimetric Depth Estimation! It was developed as part of the Advanced Topics in 3D Computer Vision course at the Technical University of Munich.

We present a supervised monocular depth prediction model leveraging polarimetric characteristics of light. During the model development, particular emphasis was put on improvement of the depth estimation for photometrically challenging objects.

For details about the project, architecture design and ablation studies, have a look at our [final presentation](PolarimetricDepthEstimation_FinalPresentation.pdf).
